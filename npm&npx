**npm** (Node Package Manager) and **npx** are both tools that come with Node.js, but they serve different purposes:

### **npm**
- **Purpose**: Package manager for installing, managing, and sharing JavaScript packages (libraries, frameworks, etc.).
- **Key Functions**:
  - Installs packages globally or locally to a project (e.g., `npm install <package>`).
  - Manages dependencies in `package.json`.
  - Runs scripts defined in `package.json` (e.g., `npm run build`).
  - Publishes packages to the npm registry.
- **Usage Example**:
  ```bash
  npm install express
  ```
  This installs the `express` package locally in the project's `node_modules` folder.
- **Behavior**: Packages are installed and stored for repeated use in your project or globally on your system.

### **npx**
- **Purpose**: Executes Node.js packages, either from the npm registry or locally, without needing to install them globally or permanently.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Runs a package's executable directly, downloading it temporarily if not already installed (e.g., `npx create-react-app my-app`).
  - Executes binaries from locally installed packages in `node_modules` without needing global installation.
  - Useful for one-off commands or trying tools without cluttering your system.
- **Usage Example**:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app my-app
  ```
  This downloads and runs `create-react-app` to scaffold a new React project, then discards it unless cached.
- **Behavior**: Temporarily downloads and runs a package, or uses a local version if available, avoiding global installs.

### **Key Differences**
| Feature                  | npm                                      | npx                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Role**         | Installs and manages packages            | Executes packages without installation   |
| **Installation**         | Installs packages for use in projects    | Runs packages without permanent install  |
| **Use Case**             | Managing dependencies, running scripts   | One-off commands, running local binaries |
| **Global Impact**        | Can install globally or locally          | Avoids global installs, runs temporarily |
| **Example Command**      | `npm install -g eslint`                  | `npx eslint .`                           |

### **When to Use**
- Use **npm** to install and manage dependencies for your project or to run scripts defined in `package.json`.
- Use **npx** to execute a package once, test a tool, or run a local package's binary without polluting your global environment.

### **Practical Example**
- With **npm**:
  ```bash
  npm install -g create-react-app
  create-react-app my-app
  ```
  Installs `create-react-app` globally, then runs it.
- With **npx**:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app my-app
  ```
  Runs `create-react-app` without installing it globally, downloading it temporarily if needed.

**Summary**: npm is for managing and installing packages; npx is for executing them conveniently, often without installation.
